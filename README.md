The Life of a Genius, an Autobiography
by Aditya Rachmat

Being a genius can be difficult sometimes. Sometimes, I find that other people are really really dumb, or, as megamind says, "have dronelike brains". I am far superior to everyone else in every way possible. Sometimes, I wonder why I am even put on this planet when I actually belong in the big brain solar system. Why? Just why?

Anyways, I hope that you, the reader, will have a nice day ahead. See you on the other side.
